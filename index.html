<h1>WHIPPET'S GANG</h1>	
</div>
<div id="text">
<p><h2>Why adopt a Whippet puppy?</h2> The Whippet is a small greyhound originating from Great Britain. Its name is derived from the exclamation "Wip It" which means "Go for it". Although they may look fragile, they are in fact a dog of robust health and surprising speed. His characteristics, which combine grace and power, make this elegant sighthound a true little athlete.</p>

<p>The Whippet is an intelligent and particularly emotionally sensitive dog. He is very affectionate and extremely attached to his master. Generally speaking, he barks very little and is rather quiet by nature. 
Sensitive, he is a very affectionate and sociable dog who will find his place in the home. They need a lot of love and attention. Do not expect him to sleep quietly in his basket, he will prefer to be warm with you under the covers.
This is a dog that can be very calm indoors as well as fiery outdoors with his incredible speed. He is easy to live with and adapts well to his environment.
Although he is a thief, he is a very intelligent dog and easy to train. He is the ideal companion, he will love to go everywhere with you.</p>
